# NWA Piranha CNC Post Processor for Fusion 360

Welcome to the repository for the NWA Piranha CNC post processor file for Fusion 360. This repository is maintained for internal use by our robotics team to facilitate easy access and updates to the post processor file.

## Overview

This repository contains the post processor file needed to generate CNC code for the NWA Piranha CNC machine using Autodesk Fusion 360. The post processor ensures that the CNC code generated by Fusion 360 is compatible with the NWA Piranha CNC machine, allowing for precise and efficient machining.

## Getting Started

To use the post processor file with Fusion 360, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the post processor file directly.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/robotique-sainteanne/postprocessors.git
    ```

2. Open Autodesk Fusion 360.

3. Go to the "MANUFACTURE" workspace.

4. In the toolbar, select "Post Process."

5. In the Post Process dialog, click on the "Setup" tab.

6. Click on the folder icon next to the "Post Configuration" field.

7. Navigate to the location where you saved the post processor file and select it.

8. Configure any additional settings as needed.

9. Click "Post" to generate the CNC code.
